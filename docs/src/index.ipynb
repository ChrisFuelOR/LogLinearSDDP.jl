    "This code implements a special version of **stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP)** and is based on (an earlier version of) [SDDP.jl](https://github.com/odow/SDDP.jl) from Oscar Dowson.\n",
    "The special version of SDDP, which we refer to as **loglinearSDDP**, is tailored to solve multistage stochastic linear problems with **log-linear autoregressive uncertainty** in the right-hand side.\n",
    "By this we mean that the uncertain data in the right-hand side is stagewise dependent and described by an autoregressive process that is linear in the natural logarithm of its lagged variables."
