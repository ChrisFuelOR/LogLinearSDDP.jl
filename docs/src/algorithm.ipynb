   "source": [
    " * `algorithm.jl`:\n",
    "     * Contains the main functions from (an earlier version of) SDDP.jl such as `train`, `backward_pass`, `solve_subproblem` etc. that are required for SDDP to work.\n",
    "     * Includes a few adjustments to our specific version of SDDP.\n",
    "     * In `parameterize` it is made sure that the cut intercepts are re-evaluated for a given scenario.\n",
    "     * Before calling the `train` method, the `train_loglinear` function is called to initialize the history of the stochastic process, to compute the cut exponents $\\Theta$ (see [cut representation](cuts.md)), adjust the value functions (Bellman functions) to our needs etc.\n",
    " * `ar_preparations.jl`:\n",
    "     * Contains function `initialize_process_state` which uses the history from the `AutoregressiveProcess` struct to set up the initial state of the stochastic process. This state is then used as an input for following stages.\n",
    "     * If not enough history is provided by the user, based on the maximum dimension $L$ and the lag order $p$ some default history will be created by the code.\n",
    " * `bellman.jl` and `bellman_redefine.jl`:\n",
    "     * Contains the functionality of the value functions (Bellman functions) that are approximated within SDDP, mostly borrowed from SDDP.jl\n",
    "     * Includes a few adjustments for our case, e.g. making sure that the code works with our extended `Cut` structs and our specific cut formulas (see [cut representation](cuts.md)).\n",
    " * `cut_computations.jl`\n",
    "     * Contains most of the computations that are related to our special version of SDDP\n",
    "     * `compute_cut_exponents` computes the exponents $\\Theta$ that are used in the cut formulas (see [cut representation](cuts.md)). They only have to be computed once in advance before the iteration loop in SDDP is started. Note that, compared to the paper, the indexing is a bit different. Precisely, $\\theta(t,\\tau,\\ell,m,k)$ from the paper (with $k$ a stage) translates to `cut_exponents_stage[t][τ,ℓ,m,κ]` (with κ the lag and κ $= t-k$).\n",
    "     * `evaluate_cut_intercepts` updates the existing cut intercepts to a given scenario.\n",
    "     * `evaluate_stochastic_cut_intercept_tight` evaluates the cut intercept at the incumbent (including the current process state) where it is constructed.\n",
    "     * `update_process_state` updates the state of the stochastic process for a specific realization that was sampled. The current process state is always stored in `node.ext[:process_state]`.\n",
    "     * `compute_scenario_factors` computes the scenario-specific factors $\\prod_{k=t-p}^{t-1} \\prod_{m=1}^{L_k} \\xi_{km}^{\\Theta(t,\\tau,\\ell,m,k)}$ that are required in the cut intercept formula (see [cut representation](cuts.md)). They are the same for all cuts.\n",
    "     * `adapt_intercepts` iterates over all existing cuts to adjust the intercepts. To this end, first the final intercept value is computed using the `scenario_factors` and then `cut_intercept_variable` is fixed to this value.\n",
    " * `duals.jl`:\n",
    "     * Contains the backward pass functionality of SDDP to compute optimal dual multipliers / cut coefficients. Compared to SDDP.jl this is enhanced a lot to be tailored to our special version of SDDP. In particular, the cut intercept factors $\\alpha$ that are required in the cut formulas (see [cut representation](cuts.md)) are computed.\n",
    "     * `get_alpha` controls the process of computing these factors $\\alpha$.\n",
    "     * `compute_alpha_t` computes the value of $\\alpha^{(t)}$.\n",
    "     * `compute_alpha_tau` computes the value $\\alpha^{(\\tau)}$. If `simplified` is set to `True` in the `AutoregressiveProcess` struct, then a simplified version of this computation can be applied to accelerate the solution process\n",
    "     * `get_existing_cut_factors` computes the first factor $\\sum_{r \\in R_{t+1}} \\rho^*_{rtj} \\alpha_{r,t+1,\\ell}^{(\\tau)}$ required for the computation of $\\alpha$. It requires to iterate over all previously generated cuts and to multiply the corresponding dual multiplier with a cut intercept factor of that cut.\n",
    " * `logging.jl`: Controls (most of) the logging of SDDP.\n",
    " * `sampling_schemes.jl`:\n",
    "     * Contains functionality for the correct sampling of scenarios within SDDP.\n",
    "     * Function `sample_scenario` is taken from SDDP.jl, but adjusted to make sure that it fits log-linear AR processes. It computes a new realization of $\\xi_t$ as required in the forward pass. To to dis, it is first sampled only from the stagewise independent process $\\eta_t$ using functionality from SDDP.jl. Using the current state of the process and the process formula, then the new value of $\\xi_t$ is computed (see formula (15) in the paper).\n",
    "     * `update_process_state` uses the new realization to update the state of the process for the following stage.\n",
    "     * `sample_backward_noise_terms` is the analogue to `sample_scenario` but for the backward pass of SDDP.\n",
    " * `simulate.jl`: Takes the simulation functionality from SDDP.jl and adjusts it to fit our purposes, e.g. by using our tailored `sample_scenario` function.\n",
    " * `typedefs.jl`: Contains the definition of the `ProblemParams`, `AlgoParams`, `AutoregressiveProcess` and `AutoregressiveProcessStage` structs discussed above."

    "> **Remarks**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. We have used packages Tullio.jl and LoopVectorization.jl (with macro `@turbo`) to speed up the computations within `cut_computations.jl` and `duals.jl` as much and keep the overhead to standard SDDP as small as possible.\n",
    "> 2. We have also implemented some Gurobi-specific methods, e.g. to accelerate the variable fixing or dual muliplier evaluation. These variants can only be used if the correct Gurobi-internal indices for the cut intercept variable, the coupling constraints or the cut constraints are provided using parameters `gurobi_fix_start` `gurobi_coupling_index_start` and  `gurobi_cut_index_start`. For our [hydrothermal scheduling problem](example/experiment_description.md) these values have been identified in advance."
