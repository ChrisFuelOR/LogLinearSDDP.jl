The estimates are stored in folder `AutoregressivePreparation` and then `bic_model` (or `custom_model`) in some txt-files (for the linear case it is `LinearizedAutoregressivePreparation`). Each txt-file contains the months, the lag order, the process intercept, the process coefficients, the factor multiplied with the error term and the standard error from the estimation.\n",
