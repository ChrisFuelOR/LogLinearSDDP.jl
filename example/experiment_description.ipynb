    "To test our proposed variant of SDDP, loglinearSDDP, and compare it to existing variants, we conducted experiments on a hydrothermal scheduling problem from the literature [CITE]. The multistage problem has $T=120$ stages, uses 4 aggregated reservoirs, 95 generators and is based on real data from the Brazilian hydro power system. The hydro inflows into the reservoirs are considered stochastic and modeled by an autoregressive process."
